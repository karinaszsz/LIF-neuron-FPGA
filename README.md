This repository contains an implementation of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model on an FPGA. 
The implementation is based on the equations provided in SNNTorch documentation (https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_2.html), 
with modifications to accommodate the constraints of FPGA operations (float calculation in FPGA is HARD).

Sincerely, 
Me and friends (Ditya and Rakasiwi).
